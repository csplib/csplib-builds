$ n: the side length of the board
given n : int(1..)

$ Index: cell indicies can be between 1 and n on both axes
$ Cell: a cell is a tuple made up of two elements, an x-index and a y-index
letting Index be domain int(1..n+2)
letting Cell  be domain tuple (Index,Index)

$ alive: the set of cells that are alive
find alive : set of Cell

$ maximise the number of cells that are alive
maximising |alive|

such that
$ all border cells are dead
    forAll (a,b) : Cell
        , |{a,b} intersect {1,n+2}| = 0
        . !((a,b) in alive),
    
$ alive cells have between 2 and 3 alive neighbours (between 3 and 4, when
$ including the cell itself)
    forAll (a,b) in alive .
        3 <= ( sum i,j : int(-1..1) . toInt((a+i,b+j) in alive) ) /\
        (sum i,j : int(-1..1) . toInt((a+i,b+j) in alive)) <= 4,

$ dead cells must not have 3 alive neighbours
    forAll (a,b) : Cell
        , !((a,b) in alive)
        . (sum i,j : int(-1..1) . toInt((a+i,b+j) in alive)) != 3

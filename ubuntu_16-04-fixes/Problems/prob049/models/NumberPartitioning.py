# Number Partitioning
#
# In this problem, the numbers 1 to N must be arranged in two
# different groups A and B in such a way that:
# 1. A and B have the same cardinality.
# 2. The sum of numbers in A equals the sum of numbers in B.
# 3. The sum of the squares of numbers in A equals the sum of
# the squares of numbers in B.

#
# Note: There is no solution for N < 8! Also, there is no solution
# if N is not a multiple of 4! (Source: CSPLib - see above link.)

McAloon et al. report being unable to solve the 15 team problem with integer linear programming using CPLEX.

Regin has developed a [CP model](http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/pvh/ppdp99.ps), for ILOG's OPL tool that can solve up to 30 team problems.

More recently, he has added a heuristic based on Euler's theorem for Latin squares to solve 40 team problems in approximately 6 hours.

Hamiez and Hao [report](http://www.info.univ-angers.fr/pub/hao/papers/ECAI00WS.ps) solving up to 40 team problems using local search with a tabu restriction.

A more recent [paper](http://www.info.univ-angers.fr/pub/hao/papers/DAM04.pdf) by the same authors in Discrete Applied Mathemetics solves very large problems with $(T-1) mod 3 = 1$ or $2$ where $T$ is the number of teams using a repair based method.

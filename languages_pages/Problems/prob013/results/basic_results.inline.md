Using constraint programming, an optimal solution with 13 hosts was found by Barbara Smith, et al. They were unable to find an optimal solution using a variety of different ILP methods. The problem is trivially infeasible with just 12 hosts.

Walser reports fast solutions time using a local search procedure and a linear 0-1 encoding.

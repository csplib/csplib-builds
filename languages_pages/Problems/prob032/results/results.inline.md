### Known Solutions

Bob Bosch and Mike Trick have found optimal solutions up to 14 x 14.  For some larger 
sizes, the optimal solutions with some kind of symmetry are known:  for instance, 
optimal rotationally symmetric and bilaterally symmetric solutions have been found for 
the 18 x 18 problem. As far as I am aware, larger optimal solutions are not currently 
known (January 2002).

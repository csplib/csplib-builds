Instances are given as plain text files. The first line represents an integer 
denoting the number of nodes (n). The second line corresponds to the bound on the path lengths.
The third line is an integer denoting the minimum degree of each node.
The latter line is followed by n lines representing the corresponding 
distance matrix among the nodes. Entry (i,j) in this matrix represents the distance from node i 
to node j.

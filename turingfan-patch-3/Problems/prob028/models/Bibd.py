# Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) --- CSPLib prob028

# A BIBD is defined as an arrangement of v distinct objects into b blocks such
# that each block contains exactly k distinct objects, each object occurs in
# exactly r different blocks, and every two distinct objects occur together in
# exactly lambda blocks. Another way of defining a BIBD is in terms of its
# incidence matrix, which is a v by b binary matrix with exactly r ones per row,
# k ones per column, and with a scalar product of lambda 'l' between any pair of
# distinct rows.

  Magic sequence in SICStus Prolog.

  From 
  http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~ianm/CSPLib/prob/prob019/spec.html
  """
  A magic sequence of length n is a sequence of integers x0 . . xn-1
  between 0 and n-1, such that for all i in 0 to n-1, the number i 
  occurs exactly xi times in the sequence. 
  For instance, 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0 is a magic sequence since 0 occurs 
  6 times in it, 1 occurs twice, ...

  * Comet   : http://www.hakank.org/comet/magic_sequence.co
 
  Also, in the SICStus Prolog distribution there is a model
  using global_cardinality:

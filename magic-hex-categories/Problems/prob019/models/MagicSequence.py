# Magic Sequences - Magic Square variant
#
# A magic sequence of length n is a sequence of integers x[0]
# to x[n-1], such that for all i in 0 to n-1, the number i occurs
# exactly x[i] times in the sequence.
#
# For instance, 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0 is a magic sequence since 0
# occurs 6 times in it, 1 occurs twice, 2 occurs once, ...

Erdos related the following anecdote: "Aliens invade the earth and threaten to obliterate it in a year's time unless human beings can find the Ramsey number for red five and blue five [that is, R(5,5)]. We could marshal the world's best minds and fastest computers, and within a year we could probably calculate the value. If the aliens demanded the Ramsey number for red six and blue six, however, we would have no choice but to launch a preemptive attack. (Graham, Ronald L. and Joel H. Spencer. Ramsey Theory. Scientific American July 1990: 112-117).

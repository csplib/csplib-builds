A simple way to state this problem is as a pair consisting of the order of the
matrix and an upper bound on the entries (disallowing negative entries). 
For Guy's variant (see [2]), where 0 entries are also disallowed and the determinants
of the two matrices are constrained to be equal, the number of unique
solutions are as follows (as shown in [1]):

<CENTER>

Of course, this table can be extended indefinitely. The difficulty
of finding all solutions increases rapidly with the size of the domains.

The <A HREF="../references/">references</A> page gives pointers to several
solutions, both individuals and parametric families. Some examples

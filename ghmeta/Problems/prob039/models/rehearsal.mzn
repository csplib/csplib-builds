% """
% A concert is to consist of nine pieces of music of different durations 
% each involving a different combination of the five members of the orchestra. 
% Players can arrive at rehearsals immediately before the first piece in which 
% they are involved and depart immediately after the last piece in which 
% they are involved. The problem is to devise an order in which the pieces 
% can be rehearsed so as to minimize the total time that players are waiting 
% to play, i.e. the total time when players are present but not currently 
% playing. In the table below, 1 means that the player is required for 
% the corresponding piece, 0 otherwise. The duration (i.e. rehearsal time) 
% is in some unspecified time units.
%
%    Piece       1    2   3    4    5  6    7   8    9
%    Player 1    1    1   0    1    0  1    1   0    1
%    Player 2    1    1   0    1    1  1    0   1    0
%    Player 3    1    1   0    0    0  0    1   1    0
%    Player 4    1    0   0    0    1  1    0   0    1
%    Player 5    0    0   1    0    1  1    1   1    0
%    Duration    2    4   1    3    3  2    5   7    6
%
% For example, if the nine pieces were rehearsed in numerical order as 
% given above, then the total waiting time would be:
%       Player 1: 1+3+7=11
%       Player 2: 1+5=6
%       Player 3: 1+3+3+2=9
%       Player 4: 4+1+3+5+7=20
%       Player 5: 3
% giving a total of 49 units. The optimal sequence, as we shall see, 
% is much better than this.
%
% ...
% 
% The minimum waiting time for the rehearsal problem is 17 time units, and 
% an optimal sequence is 3, 8, 2, 7, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9.

% Here are all optimal sequences for Barbara M. Smith's problem

% waiting_time: [3, 5, 0, 3, 6]
% total_waiting_time: 17
% ----------
% order: [9, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3]
% waiting_time: [3, 5, 0, 3, 6]

% waiting_time: [3, 5, 0, 3, 6]
% total_waiting_time: 17
% ----------
% order: [3, 8, 7, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9]
% waiting_time: [3, 5, 0, 3, 6]

% waiting_time: [3, 5, 0, 3, 6]
% total_waiting_time: 17
% ----------
%
% Note that all waiting times are the same for 
% all sequences, i.e. player 1 always wait 3 units, etc.
%
% With symmetry breaking rule that order[1] < order[num_pieces] 
% there are 4 solutions where piece 2 and 7 can change place and 
% 5 and 6 can change place.

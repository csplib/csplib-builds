  Steiner triplets in Picat.

  """
  The ternary Steiner problem of order n is to find n(n-1)/6 sets of elements 
  in {1,2,...,n} such that each set contains three elements and any two 
  sets have at most one element in common.

  For example, the following shows a solution for size n=7:

      {1,2,3}, {1,4,5}, {1,6,7}, {2,4,6}, {2,5,7}, {3,4,7}, {3,5,6}

  Problem taken from:
  C. Gervet: Interval Propagation to Reason about Sets: Definition and 
             Implementation of a PracticalLanguage,  
             Constraints, An International Journal, vol.1, pp.191-246, 1997.

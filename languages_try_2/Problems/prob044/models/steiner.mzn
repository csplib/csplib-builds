% Steiner triplets in MiniZinc.
% 
% http://www.probp.com/examples/clpset/steiner.pl 
% The ternary Steiner problem of order n is to find n(n-1)/6 sets of elements in {1,2,...,n} 
% such that each set contains three elements and any two sets have at most one element in common. 
% For example, the following shows a solution for size n=7:
%
%      {1,2,3}, {1,4,5}, {1,6,7}, {2,4,6}, {2,5,7}, {3,4,7}, {3,5,6}
%
% Problem taken from:
%  C. Gervet: Interval Propagation to Reason about Sets: Definition and Implementation of a Practical 
%  Language,  Constraints, An International Journal, vol.1, pp.191-246, 1997.

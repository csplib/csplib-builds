# Diamond-free Degree Sequences
#
# Fill in a binary matrix of size n * n in such a way that
# - For every grouping of four rows, the sum of their non-symmetrical
#   values is less than or equal to 4,
# - No rows contain just zeroes,
# - Every row has a sum modulo 3,
# - The sum of the matrix is modulo 12.
# - No row R contains a 1 in its Rth column.
#
# Note on first constraint in model:
# A group of four nodes can have at most four edges between them.
# Since the matrix for this model will represent the adjacency
# matrix of the graph, we need to take into consideration the fact
# that the matrix will be symmetrical.

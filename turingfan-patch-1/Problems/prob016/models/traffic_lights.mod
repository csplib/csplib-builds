  Traffic lights problem in AMPL+CP.

  CSPLib problem 16
  http://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob016
  """
  Specification:
  Consider a four way traffic junction with eight traffic lights. Four of the traffic 
  lights are for the vehicles and can be represented by the variables V1 to V4 with domains 
  {r,ry,g,y} (for red, red-yellow, green and yellow). The other four traffic lights are 
  for the pedestrians and can be represented by the variables P1 to P4 with domains {r,g}.
  
  The constraints on these variables can be modelled by quaternary constraints on 
  (Vi, Pi, Vj, Pj ) for 1<=i<=4, j=(1+i)mod 4 which allow just the tuples 
  {(r,r,g,g), (ry,r,y,r), (g,g,r,r), (y,r,ry,r)}.

  It would be interesting to consider other types of junction (e.g. five roads 
  intersecting) as well as modelling the evolution over time of the traffic light sequence. 
  ...

  Results
  Only 2^2 out of the 2^12 possible assignments are solutions.
  
  (V1,P1,V2,P2,V3,P3,V4,P4) = 
     {(r,r,g,g,r,r,g,g), (ry,r,y,r,ry,r,y,r), (g,g,r,r,g,g,r,r), (y,r,ry,r,y,r,ry,r)}
     [(1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3), ( 2,1,4,1, 2,1,4,1), (3,3,1,1,3,3,1,1), (4,1, 2,1,4,1, 2,1)}


  The problem has relative few constraints, but each is very tight. Local propagation 
  appears to be rather ineffective on this problem.

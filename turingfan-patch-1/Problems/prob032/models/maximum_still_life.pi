  Maximum density still life in Picat.

  CSPLib 032: http://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob032

  This model (or rather my earlier MiniZinc and Comet models) was 
  inspired by the OPL model from
  Toni Mancini, Davide Micaletto, Fabio Patrizi, Marco Cadoli: 
  "Evaluating ASP and commercial solvers on the CSPLib"
  http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~tmancini/index.php?problemid=032&solver=OPL&spec=BASE&currItem=research.publications.webappendices.csplib2x.problemDetails#listing

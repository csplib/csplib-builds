    abstract = "In this paper we survey known results for the n -queens problem of placing n nonattacking queens on an n x n chessboard and consider extensions of the problem, e.g.Â other board topologies and dimensions. For all solution constructions, we either give the construction, an outline of it, or a reference. In our analysis of the modular board, we give a simple result for finding the intersections of diagonals. We then investigate a number of open research areas for the problem, stating several existing and new conjectures. Along with the known results for n -queens that we discuss, we also give a history of the problem. In particular, we note that the first proof that n nonattacking queens can always be placed on an n x n board for n &gt; 3 is by E. Pauls, rather than by W. Ahrens who is typically cited. We have attempted in this paper to discuss all the mathematical literature in all languages on the n -queens problem. However, we look only briefly at computational approaches. "

abstract = "A complete mapping of an algebraic structure (G,+) is a bijection f(x) of G over G such that f(x)=x+h(x) for some bijection h(x). A question often raised is, given an algebraic structure G, how many complete mappings of G there are. In this paper we investigate a somewhat different problem. That is, how difficult it is to count the number of complete mappings of G. We show that for a closed structure, the counting problem is #P-complete. For a closed structure with a left-identity and left-cancellation law, the counting problem is also #P-complete. For an abelian group, on the other hand, the counting problem is beyond the #P-class. Furthermore, the famous counting problems of n-queen and toroidal n-queen problems are both beyond the #P-class. "

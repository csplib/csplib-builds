The instances of the rehearsal problem and the talent scheduling problem given in 
the problem specification can be solved optimally using constraint programming.

The minimum waiting time for the rehearsal problem is 17 time units.
The minimum cost of waiting time for the <I>Film1</I> talent scheduling problem
is 14,600 and for <I>Film2</I> it is 8,700  (in the units used in the table - 
note that the costs in the table are /100).

	<p>The problem can be modelled with a CSP variable associated with the occurrence of each number, and its value being its position in the sequence. Alternatively, we can consider a dual model in which a CSP variable is associated with each position in the sequence, and its value being the number assigned to this position. We can also have construct a representation of the problem with both the primal and dual models, and channelling constraints between the two.</p>
<p>L(2,3) has the unique solution up to reversal of 312132. This was supposedly found by Langford&rsquo;s child. L(2,4) also has an unique solution up to reversal, 41312432 found by Langford. L(2,n) only has solutions if n=4k or 4k-1. L(2,19) has 256,814,891,280 solutions, and it took <a href="http://www.lclark.edu/~miller/langford/groth-L19.html">two months</a> of computing in 1999 to count them. The number of solutions for L(2,20) is not known.</p>
<p>L(3,n) is insoluble for n less than 9. L(3,9) has 3 solutions, whilst L(3,10) has 5 solutions. L(3,n) is insoluble for n between 11 and 16 inclusive. L(3,17), L(3,18) and L(3,19) have 13,440, 54,947 and 249,280 solutions respectively, whilst L(3,20) has no solutions.</p>
<p>John Edward Miller&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lclark.edu/~miller/langford.html">web pages</a> on Langford&rsquo;s problem including a large table of results (about half way down the long page), as well as notes about when and by whom they were proved.</p>
<p>The number of solutions to Langford&rsquo;s problem is sequence <a href="http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/njas/sequences/eisA.cgi?Anum=014552">A014552</a> in the <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/Seis.html">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.

% Langford's number problem (CSP lib problem 24)
%
% Arrange 2 sets of positive integers 1..k to a sequence,
% such that, following the first occurence of an integer i, 
% each subsequent occurrence of i, appears i+1 indices later
% than the last. 
% For example, for k=4, a solution would be 41312432

% Also see: http://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob024/
%
% However, I added a better representation were we see the numbers in their
% proper positions: the solution array.

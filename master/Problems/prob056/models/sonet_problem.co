  SONET problem in Comet.


  Translation of the EssencePrime model in the Minion Translator examples:
  http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~andrea/examples/sonet/sonet_problem.eprime
  """
  The SONET problem is a network design problem: set up a network between
  n nodes, where only certain nodes require a connection.
  Nodes are connected by putting them on a ring, where all nodes
  on a ring can communicate. Putting a node on a ring requires a so-called
  ADM, and each ring has a capacity of nodes, i.e. ADMs. There is a certain 
  amount of rings, r, that is available. The objective is to set up a network
  by using a minimal amount of ADMs.


  About the problem model

  The problem model has the amount of rings ('r'), amount of nodes('n'),
  the 'demand' (which nodes require communication) and node-capacity of each 
  ring ('capacity_nodes') as parameters.
  The assignement of nodes to rings is modelled by a 2-dimensional matrix 'rings',
  indexed by the amnount of rings and nodes. The matrix-domain is boolean:
  If the node in column j is assigned to the ring in row i, then rings[i,j] = 1 
  and 0 otherwise. So all the '1's in the matrix 'rings' stand for an ADM.
  Hence the objective is to minimise the sum over all columns and rows of matrix
  'rings'.

Stanislaw Radziszowski has written an [survey of results up to 2004](http://web.archive.org/web/20070910030931/http://www3.combinatorics.org/Surveys/ds1.ps) for all types of Ramsey numbers.
The special case of R(k,k) numbers has attracted perhaps the most attention. R(4,4) has been shown to equal 18. R(5,5) is only known to lie between 43 and 49. This is a very difficult combinatorial problem.

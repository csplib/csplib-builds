The problem has no solution. This shows that finite projective planes
of order 10 do not exist.

The proof caused some controversy as it used computer brute force
(2,000 hours on a Cray) and no one has been able (or is ever likely to
be able) to check it by hand. Can constraint satisfaction algorithms
reduce the size of this task?
